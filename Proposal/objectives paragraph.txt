To achieve the objective of the project will require extensive research into many factors such as regulations, hardware, programming, pcb fabrication, sensors, microcontrollers, materials, etc. The aim of this project is to broadcast data from the stratosphere via onboard telemetry during the weather balloon’s ascent and descent. The type of data to collected may include altitude, temperature, air pressure, and will require GPS for tracking of the balloon and mounted camera(s) for videos/images to use in the final report. This may also include the transmission of an TVL-600 analogue camera for live viewing of the balloon during the initial launch. Calculations will be made to ensure the payload is within the lifting capabilities of the balloon, along with research of the expected burst time, burst altitude, landing location and time of retrieval of the balloon. The onboard telemetry will also likely include custom fabricated pcbs for the various onboard sensors.
