# Arduino_HAB_Tracker
Undergraduate Dissertation HAB Telemetry Development

This is a HAB tracker PCB I am making for my final year project based on information provided by the UKHAS (society)
I am building this from breakout boards, which is not my preferred solution, but it will speed up developement 10-fold (I don't have the time for anything pretty right now)

It features an Arduino UNO (clone), Ublox-M8Q (GPS) Radiometrix NTX2B, BH1750 (light sensor), BMP280 (pressure sensor), ML8511 (UV sensor), MPU-9250 (9 Axis Sensor, 3D acc, 3D GYR, 3D Mag), MS5611 (Super-high alitude sensor), and voltage sensor (this consists of a voltage divider so many be implemented directly)
