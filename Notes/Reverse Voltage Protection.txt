There are many ways to provide voltage protection to a circuit

	- Series diode after power source (Basic, not great, alot of wasted heat)
	- Series shotkey diode after power source (Better, less heat wasted but still not the ultimate method)
	- P-channel mosfet with Drain conected in series with the positive supply and the source connected to the load (Absolute best way)
	
	
	Wasted heat calculation
	
		Forward Voltage x Current = Wasted Power
		
	How much is too much wasted heat?
		Anything approaching 2W is on the high side.
		A max of 1W or below is preferrable.
		
	Which diode?
		P/N 1N4001 [1]
	Which Shotkey diode?
		P/N MBRA130  [1]
		
	Which P-channel Mosfet?
